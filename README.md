# Roku Slideshow App
This app was built as a learning exercise for me. It demonstrates tasks, observers, animations, the event loop, and some front end UI stuff too. Originally it was an idea for my Lobby TV at my side job at Dal, to show announcements, reminders and resources for students. This version is slightly different, it's just a dynamic slideshow app (I'm too lazy to change the splash images). All pictures come from Unsplash's API, and artist/photographer credit is shown below the picture title where possible. The weather data is coming from the free OpenWeather API. Both APIs require an API key which you can get by signing up on their site. You'll have to put both in the api_keys.json file. The app will launch without them, but it will show errors.
