# rokuLobbyApp
This app was designed to show announcements and reminders on the lobby TV in my building.

Currently, Roku devices (especially the lowest end devices) are actually quite affordable and relatively easy to develop for. Previously we had a system of TVs on a closed network via coax cable displaying announcements, reminders, and events in the lobbies. I was told the system was complicated and required quite a bit of maintenance and infrastructure. Eventually it appears to have been abandoned, although the TVs are still there. This seemed like a lightweight solution to bring them back, as well as an oppurtunity to demonstrate some Brightscript principles.
